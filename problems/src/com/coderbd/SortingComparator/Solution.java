Comparators are used to compare two objects. In this challenge, you'll create a comparator and use it to sort an array. The Player class is provided in the editor below. It has two fields:

: a string.
: an integer.
Given an array of  Player objects, write a comparator that sorts them in order of decreasing score. If  or more players have the same score, sort those players alphabetically ascending by name. To do this, you must create a Checker class that implements the Comparator interface, then write an int compare(Player a, Player b) method implementing the
